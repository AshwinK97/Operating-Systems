# Conceptual Questions

## 1. Explain what MPI is, what are it's benefits?
MPI (Message Passing Interface), is a standardized message-passing system that allows applications to work with a wide variety of parallel computing architectures. MPI is essentially a communications protocol for programming parallel computers. Bu unifying the various message passing protocols, MPI makes it easier for developers to write applications that are portable to all major architectures. MPI mixes point-to-point and collaborative communications which allow you to create highly complex parallel applications.

## 2. Explain briefly how MPI supports running on separate computers in a cluster.

## 3. Name **four** MPI data types.

## 4. Explain MPI_Bcast function.

## 5. Exmplain MPI_Send and MPI_Recv functions.
